# Data-Science-PortfolioData Science Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases my projects demonstrating end-to-end data science solutions, from problem definition and data acquisition to machine learning modeling, evaluation, and actionable insights.

Projects
1. Brandazon E-commerce Analytics Demo
This project features a simulated e-commerce website, "Brandazon," designed to demonstrate comprehensive analytics tracking using Segment. It's modeled after a real-world online shopping experience, including product listings, a shopping cart, and a checkout flow. The primary purpose of this application is to generate rich user behavioral event data, which then feeds into the "User Engagement Analytics Project" (described below).

Live Demo: https://bcaudillo.github.io/brandazon-ecommerce/

How to Verify Segment Events:
You can directly observe the event generation in real-time using your browser's developer tools:

Open the Live Demo in your web browser.

Open Developer Tools:

Chrome/Edge/Firefox: Right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element," or press Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) / Cmd+Option+I (macOS).

Go to the "Network" Tab.

Filter for Segment Events: In the filter/search bar within the Network tab, type segment.

Interact with the Site: As you click through the Brandazon website (e.g., navigate to "Products," click "View Details" on a product, add items to cart, proceed to checkout), you will see network requests related to segment.com appear in the Network tab.

Inspect Payloads: Click on any of these segment.com requests (they might appear as v1/t for track events or v1/p for page events). Go to the "Payload" or "Request Payload" tab within the details panel. Here, you can examine the JSON structure of the event, including its name (e.g., Product Clicked, Product Added, Order Completed), properties (e.g., product_id, price, quantity), and context (e.g., utm_source if you arrived via the "Simulate Ad" page). This demonstrates how user interactions are captured as structured data.

2. User Engagement Analytics Project (Python)
This project focuses on leveraging the synthetic event data generated by the Brandazon E-commerce demo to perform in-depth user engagement analytics and build machine learning models. The goal is to identify behavioral signals that predict customer retention, conversion, and churn, and to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

Dataset Overview:
The project uses a synthetic dataset meticulously modeled on Segment's event schema, including identify, page, screen, and track calls, along with rich context objects. This data simulates real-world user interactions on an e-commerce platform.

How to Use/Run the Python Project:

Prerequisites:

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Required Python libraries (install via pip): pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm (for progress bars), and potentially xgboost, shap for modeling.

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tqdm xgboost shap
