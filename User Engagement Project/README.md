# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**!  
This repository showcases my projects demonstrating end-to-end data science solutions â€” from problem definition and data acquisition to machine learning modeling, evaluation, and actionable insights.

## Projects

### 1. Brandazon E-commerce Analytics Demo

This project features a simulated e-commerce website, **Brandazon**, designed to demonstrate comprehensive analytics tracking using Segment. It models a real-world online shopping experience, including product listings, a shopping cart, and a checkout flow.  

The primary purpose of this application is to generate rich user behavioral event data, which then feeds into the **User Engagement Analytics Project** (described below).

**ðŸ”— Live Demo:** [Brandazon E-commerce](https://bcaudillo.github.io/brandazon-ecommerce/)

#### How to Verify Segment Events

You can directly observe the event generation in real-time using your browser's developer tools:

1. Open the [Live Demo](https://bcaudillo.github.io/brandazon-ecommerce/) in your browser.
2. Open Developer Tools:  
   - **Chrome/Edge/Firefox**: Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** or press  
     `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+I` (macOS).
3. Go to the **Network** tab.
4. **Filter for Segment Events**: In the search bar, type `segment`.
5. **Interact with the Site**:  
   - Navigate to **Products**  
   - Click **View Details** on a product  
   - Add items to cart  
   - Proceed to checkout  
   - Youâ€™ll see requests to `segment.com` (e.g., `v1/t` for track events, `v1/p` for page events).
6. **Inspect Payloads**:  
   - Click any `segment.com` request.  
   - In the **Payload** or **Request Payload** tab, examine the JSON structure of the event.  
   - Example fields include:  
     - **Event Name**: `Product Clicked`, `Product Added`, `Order Completed`  
     - **Properties**: `product_id`, `price`, `quantity`  
     - **Context**: `utm_source` (if you arrived via the "Simulate Ad" page)  

This demonstrates how user interactions are captured as structured data.

### 2. User Engagement Analytics Project (Python)

This project leverages the synthetic event data generated by the Brandazon demo to perform **user engagement analytics** and build **machine learning models**.  

**Goals:**  
- Identify behavioral signals that predict **retention**, **conversion**, and **churn**  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of **marketing campaigns**

#### Dataset Overview

- Synthetic dataset modeled on **Segmentâ€™s event schema**  
- Includes: `identify`, `page`, `screen`, and `track` calls  
- Rich **context objects** (e.g., device, campaign, location)  
- Simulates real-world user interactions on an e-commerce platform  

#### How to Run the Python Project

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tqdm xgboost shap
